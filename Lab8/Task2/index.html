            <h1>NEW MINECRAFT WOLVES!</h1>
            <p>One of the first things I do when I load up a new world in Minecraft is find my wolf Zero. Zero has
                existed in every Minecraft world I’ve ever played, no matter what. Sometimes I find Zero in a tundra
                biome. Sometimes I find them between the tall pine trees of a forest biome. But I always, always, have a
                wolf named Zero by my side. And for many years, and countless Minecraft worlds, Zero has always looked
                the same.</p>
            <p>Because today eight new wolf variations are coming to testing in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition beta and
                preview AND Minecaft: Java Edition snapshot. As always when a feature goes into testing, we’d really
                love to hear your thoughts on the new wolf variations, so please let us know! Zero and I will also be
                giving our feedback throughout this article with a “wolf cuteness scale” and a Zero approval rating. I
                wonder which wolf will win? You’ll have to read all the way to the end to find out (it’s worth it, I
                promise. I a treat there, too!) Who’s a good reader?</p>
            <p>This familiar friend now has a brand-new name! The original wolf will now become “the pale wolf” (don’t
                worry Zero, we’ll go straight to the desert for some sunshine). You’ll be able to find the pale wolf in
                the taiga biome: famous for its grassland, spruce trees, and now its pale wolves!</p>
            <p>This isn’t a wolf that’s forgotten how to wolf. No! This is the rusty wolf, which you can find hiding
                between the jungle vines. I think a red collar is going to look very stylish with its copper-toned fur.
            </p>
            <p>Wolf armor absorbs all enemy damage until it breaks, protecting your wolf's hearts from those pesky
                creeper blasts. Speaking of wolf hearts – wolf-health-parity came with the most recent Bedrock Preview
                and Beta, meaning every wolf across both editions of Minecraft will now have 40 hearts when fully grown
                (Bedrock wolves only had 20 previously! Perhaps I should’ve called my wolf buddy Squishy instead of
                Zero?). Keeping your wolf armor in top condition will keep your wolf healthy while it’s adventuring by
                your side. Wolf armor that needs repairing will show cracks, and you can repair it using armadillo
                scutes! Which is perfect, because after you’ve gone to all that trouble to brush an armadillo, dye your
                armor that perfect shade of magenta, and then equip it on your four-legged friend, you don’t want it to
                break. You don’t even need to remove the armor to mend it – just apply armadillo scutes directly to
                patch up any cracks (just like an iron golem with iron ingots!) </p>

            <p>These features are all still in development, which means that the details outlined above might change as
                we iterate on them. So then why have we released them into testing? Because we want your feedback!</p>
